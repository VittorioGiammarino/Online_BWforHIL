# Plan
- The paper focuses on using either a discretized parameterization (look-up tables) or Neural Networks for the batch and the online version of the Baum Welch algorithm in the options framework.
- Simple experiment has just an illustrative purpose to explain the algorithm with a simple example.
- More structured examples consider: Grid world scenario, Mountain Car, Pendulum and Cart Pole.
- In Cappe for HMM the algorithm is implemented for an HMM which is not within the options framework.
